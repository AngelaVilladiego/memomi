Personalizing your notes, finding a memo on your desk, and recognizing who it's from just from the style and handwriting are becoming a thing of the past as the black and white of emails and messaging systems take over. 

Memomi brings back the personality, color, and connection opportunities of the traditional office memo pad while taking full advantage of modern technology to make office life brighter and easier!
